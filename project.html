            <h1>Coffee Lover Project</h1><br>
            <h2>Reasons to love Coffee</h2><br>

            <h3>The Aroma</h3>
            <p>There is no smell I love waking up to more than fresh brewed coffee, especially on Saturday mornings with
                my husband. There is just something so inviting about the smell of coffee that makes me feel ready to
                face the day or feel renewed midday. I actually love the aroma of coffee so much that I even have
                coffee-scented candles. They’re heavenly, but they’re nothing quite like the scent of a freshly brewed
                cup of coffee from one of the automatic office coffee machines.</p>
            <h3>The Taste</h3>
            <p>I have always loved the taste of coffee – it was never something I had to acquire the taste for or get
                used to. I appreciate the taste of coffee without any creamers or sugar. I can’t tell you how excited I
                was when I began to be able to taste the difference between the different roasts and brands. When you
                appreciate coffee for more than the caffeine it provides, that’s when you truly begin to love coffee.
            <h3>It Gives Me Energy</h3>
            <p>Now, don’t get me wrong…I do love coffee for the caffeine it provides! Somedays coffee really is the only
                thing that can get me up and feeling like I can accomplish my dreams and goals. It gives me the boost I
                need to stay focused and energized. It’s my midday pick-me-up that perks me up and keeps me fueled for
                the rest of the day.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>It’s Conversational</h3>
            <p>There is nothing more inviting and comforting than conversations over coffee. This has become a trend in
                today’s culture – going on coffee dates, meeting up for coffee, etc. Unlike most trends, this is
                actually a good trend that should stay. Coffee and conversation just make sense. I have has so many
                awesome and meaningful conversations over coffee with a ton of different people. The warmth of coffee
                just sets the tone of acceptance and understanding, which is why I believe it’s the most conversational
                beverage.</p>
            <h3>It Helps Me Relax</h3>
            <p>Believe it or not, coffee helps me relax. Like I have mentioned before, from its scent to its taste, it’s
                overall and inviting experience. Because coffee is so inviting, I think it’s just natural for me that I
                feel comforted and at ease when I can sit back and enjoy a cup. I am not a morning person at all, which
                means I wake up slowly. Coffee is a great way to ease me back to life, but keep me feeling relaxed at
                the same time</p>
            <h3>Its Cultural Character</h3>
            <p>Coffee beans grows all over the world, which means that coffee can be widely diverse. If you’re a lover
                of coffee because of the taste like I am, then I’m sure you have an appreciate for different origins.
                From Ethiopia, to Brazil, to Columbia and further beyond…a coffee brew bag filled with character and
                unique qualities. It’s just so intriguing to me to learn about where my coffee actually comes from and
                how it was processed. Coffee really is a form of art, and where it’s from is where the art begins.</p>
